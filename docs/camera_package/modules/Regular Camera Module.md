## Import Statements

This script uses the following Python libraries:

```python
import cv2
import numpy as np
```

- `cv2`: This is the OpenCV library which is used for handling video capturing, image processing, and resizing.
- `numpy`: NumPy is used for handling arrays and performing mathematical operations.

The script also imports a custom module:

```python
from src.modules.networking.networking import Networking
```

- `Networking`: A custom networking module to handle socket connections, and data transmission and reception.

## Functions

### `image_resize()`

This function resizes an input image to a specified width or height while maintaining the image's aspect ratio.

```python
def image_resize(image, width = None, height = None, inter = cv2.INTER_AREA):
```

**Parameters:**

- `image`: The input image to be resized in NumPy array form.
- `width` (optional): The desired width of the output image. If `None`, the width of the output image is determined by the `height` parameter and the input image's aspect ratio.
- `height` (optional): The desired height of the output image. If `None`, the height of the output image is determined by the `width` parameter and the input image's aspect ratio.
- `inter` (optional): The interpolation method used for resizing. The default is `cv2.INTER_AREA`, which is suitable for shrinking image size.

**Returns:**

- The resized image in numpy array form.

## Classes

### `Regular`

The `Regular` class encompasses the functionality of capturing frames from a specified camera, resizing them, and sending them over to a client using a socket connection.

#### `__init__()`

This constructor initializes an instance of the `Regular` class and connects to the camera.

```python
def __init__(self, host, port, camera_id):
```

**Parameters:**

- `host`: The host address where the socket server is running.
- `port`: The port number where the socket server listens.
- `camera_id`: The ID of the camera from which frames will be captured.

#### `bind()`

This method starts the socket server and waits for a client to connect.

```python
def bind(self):
```

#### `send_frame()`

This method captures a frame from the camera, resizes it, and sends it to the client as a numpy array.

```python
def send_frame(self):
```

#### `close()`

This method closes the client connection, the server socket, and releases the camera.

```python
def close(self):
```

#### `run()`

This method enters a loop that continuously captures frames from the camera and sends them to the client until a keyboard interrupt is detected. Then, it gracefully closes the resources.

```python
def run(self):
```

## Standalone Execution

If this script is run as a standalone application (i.e., not imported as a module), it will create an instance of the `Regular` class and begin the process of capturing and sending frames.

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    try:
        camera = Regular('localhost', 9999, 0)
        camera.run()
    except Exception as e:
        print("Error in main: ", e)
```
