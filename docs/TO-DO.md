# TO-DO List
1. Analyze competition data to determine what we have to do exactly
2. Develop the overal structure and determine what exactly we need
3. Begin development with the focus on manual controls, as modular as possible
4. After completion of basic sub controls we can switch to autonomous piloting
5. Design simulation environments to test autonomous (doubt mechanical and electrical will be done in time)
6. Test and develop and repeat

# Preferences:
- Written in mainly python
- As modular as possible, if the code is executed multiple times or in different files then put it in a module
