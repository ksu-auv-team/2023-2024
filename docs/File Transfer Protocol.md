**Step 1: Downloading FileZilla**
1. Open your web browser and navigate to the FileZilla download page at: https://filezilla-project.org/download.php?type=client
2. On this page, you will see several options. For most users, the recommended version will be suitable. Click the "Download" button next to it.

**Step 2: Installing FileZilla**
1. Once the download is complete, navigate to the download folder on your computer, and double-click on the FileZilla setup file to start the installation process.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions, accepting the terms and conditions and choosing the destination folder for the installation. For most users, the default settings will be appropriate.
3. Click on the 'Install' button to start the installation.
4. Once the installation is complete, click on the 'Finish' button.

**Step 3: Connecting to a Server with FileZilla**
To connect to a server, you will need some information about the server. Specifically, you will need:
1. Host = 139.177.202.102
2. Username = KSUAUV
3. Password = KSUAUV
4. Port = 9663

Once you have this information, you can connect to the server:

**Step 1: Open Site Manager**
1. Open FileZilla.
2. Click on "File" in the menu bar, and then choose "Site Manager" from the dropdown menu, or press CTRL+S on your keyboard.

**Step 2: Add New Site**
1. In the Site Manager window, click on the "New Site" button on the bottom left.
2. Give this site a name. This could be anything descriptive to help you identify the server later.

**Step 3: Enter Server Details**
In the right-hand panel of the Site Manager, enter your server details:
1. "Host": 139.177.202.102
2. "Port": 9663
3. "Protocol": SFTP
4. "Logon Type": User: KSUAUV Password: KSUAUV

**Step 4: Connect to the Server**
1. Once you've entered all your information, click "Connect" to connect to the server immediately. FileZilla will save this site, so you can easily connect to it later.
2. Alternatively, you can click "OK" to save the server details and close the Site Manager. The next time you want to connect to this server, open Site Manager and select the server from the list on the left, then click "Connect".

If everything is entered correctly, you will see the directory structure of the server appear in the right-hand window of FileZilla. If you have trouble connecting, make sure you have entered all the information correctly.
