## Python Library Imports
This script utilizes several Python libraries, namely:
- `socket`: A built-in Python library for creating network connections.
- `logging`: A standard Python library used for producing log messages.
- `numpy (np)`: A library for powerful numerical operations in Python, particularly useful when dealing with arrays.
- `io.BytesIO`: A utility from Python's built-in `io` library for managing binary streams.

```python
import socket
import logging
import numpy as np
from io import BytesIO
```

## Classes
### `Networking`
The `Networking` class is an extension of Python's built-in `socket` class, adding additional methods to send and receive numpy arrays and strings over a socket connection.

#### `__init__(self, *args, **kwargs)`
The constructor for the `Networking` class, initializing an instance and setting the buffer size to `1024`.

#### `connect(self, host, port)`
Method to connect to a server at a specific host address and port number.
**Parameters:**
- `host`: The host address of the server.
- `port`: The port number on the server to connect to.

#### `send_numpy(self, array)`
Method to send a NumPy array to the connected server.
**Parameters:**
- `array`: The NumPy array to send to the server.

#### `recv_numpy(self)`
Method to receive a NumPy array from the connected server.
**Returns:**
- The NumPy array received from the server.

#### `send_string(self, string)`
Method to send a string to the connected server.
**Parameters:**
- `string`: The string to send to the server.

#### `recv_string(self)`
Method to receive a string from the connected server.
**Returns:**
- The string received from the server.

#### `_recvall(self)`
Private method to receive all data until the string 'END\n' is found.
**Returns:**
- The received data up until (but not including) 'END\n'.

#### `_pack_numpy(array)`
Static method to pack a NumPy array into binary format.
**Parameters:**
- `array`: The NumPy array to pack.
**Returns:**
- The packed NumPy array in binary format.

#### `close_connection(self)`
Method to close the socket connection.
